# AppleFestivalForm
I took the work I created for the Ithaca Apple Festival project and changed the merchandise page to create an order form that changes dynamically by giving users feedback. I created this form by implementing JavaScript. This project went through in depth user testing as I considered how to best go about creating the form.

If you use the link above it will take you to the home page of the Ithaca Apple Fest Website I redesigned. Once you get to the homepage and fill out the form! You will see that the form gets submitted since the results of it goes to an email.

This folder contains my design journey, which goes over the process of how I came about with my design. In it I discuss my choices and rationale behind my design. Also, the notes of my user testing it there too.
