# AppleFestivalForm
I took the work I created for the Ithaca Apple Festival project and changed the merchandise page to create an order form that changes dynamically by giving users feedback. I created this form by implementing JavaScript. This project went through in depth user testing as I considered how to best go about creating the form.

If you use the link above it will take you to the home page of the Ithaca Apple Fest Website I redesigned. Once you get to the homepage and fill out the form! You will see that the form gets submitted since the results of it goes to an email.
